Interesting Article

I found this article about software engineering:
[The Pragmatic Programmer – 20 Years Later](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition-15e19ca76e40)

Why I Chose It

I like this article because it revisits one of the most influential software development books of all time and explains how its lessons still apply today. It discusses practical advice like continuous learning, adaptability, and writing clean, maintainable code.
What stood out to me most was the idea that being a good developer isn’t only about coding but also about mindset—solving problems creatively and communicating clearly. I think these are  skills that will always matter, no matter how technology changes.
